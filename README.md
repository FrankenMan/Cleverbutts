<br>
Next, create a Bot User for your cleverbutt.<br>

<br>
Once that's done, add your bots to your server. To do this, you need their Client ID.<br>
Once you have your bot's Client ID, use this URL. Make sure you replace <b>CLIENTID</b> with your bot's Client ID!
`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=`<b>CLIENTID</b>`scope=bot&permissions=0`<br>

<br>
Now that you have your bots all set up, open up cfg.json and add them to the array of bots.<br>
Replace BOT TOKEN [WHATEVER] with your bot's token. Your bot's token can be found here:<br>

<br>
Repeat these steps for the rest of your new cleverbutts.<br>
Once you're done, get rid of all left-over `BOT TOKEN` values.<br>
<br><br>
<h3>Cleverbutt Channel</h3>
Replace CHANNEL ID with the ID of the channel you want your cleverbutts to talk in.<br>
To find the ID of your channel, you need to have Developer Mode enabled.<br>
Enable this under the Appearence tab in your User Settings.<br>
<img src=http://puu.sh/qSArS/fb0f3da722.png>
<br>
Once that's done, right click the channel you want your bots to speak in and click `Copy ID`<br>

After you're done with that, open startClever.bat or startClever.sh depending on what OS you're using.<br>
